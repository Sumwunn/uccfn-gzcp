# UCCFN-GZCP : Unofficial Complex CF Nexus GZDoom Compatibility Patch

## EXPERIMENTAL; there could be many broken things

"Can you feel it? The walls between a working mod and that unplumbed dimension of bugs are tenuously thin here..."

## Installation & Tips

- **Check releases page for instructions and downloads**
- Each patch release only supports a specific Complex CF Nexus version
- For existing Complex CF Nexus installs, make sure you're up-to-date to minimize issues
- Load Complex CF Nexus with no additional mods (Corruption Cards is probably OK) to minimize issues
- I recommend using a fresh .ini to prevent possible conflict with other mods (see Issue #1)

## Known Issues

- Check TODO.md

### Notes
